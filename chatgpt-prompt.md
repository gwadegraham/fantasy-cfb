Create a college football fantasy brand named "Campus Clash" in retro style. Bold, collegiate-style text that says "Campus Clash"

The design should include:
- A stylized football at the top or center.
- Architectural elements that resemble iconic college buildings, such as domed halls or campus towers.
- Use the primary color #1E3A8A for accents, and place everything on a solid black background
- Use a distressed texture and a muted color palette (like #1E3A8A, cream, and black)
- Add bold cursive text for the logo name and a collegiate-style badge showing the founding year 2023
- The overall look should feel like a worn 1980s athletic emblem.
